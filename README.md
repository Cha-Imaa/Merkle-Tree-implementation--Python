# Merkle-Tree-implementation--Python

Merkle trees map the input files to a unique fixed-size root hash used as a fingerprint 
of the entire data, minor changes made to the data can be easily identified since it would 
result in significant changes in the root hash (The Avalanche Effect), this process allows 
verifying data integrity in peer-to-peer networks.
