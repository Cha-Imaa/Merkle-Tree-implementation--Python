# Merkle-Tree-implementation--Python

Merkle trees map the input files to a unique fixed-size root hash used as a fingerprint 
of the entire data, minor changes made to the data can be easily identified since it would 
result in significant changes in the root hash ( The Avalanche Effect ), this process allows 
verifying data integrity in peer-to-peer networks.
